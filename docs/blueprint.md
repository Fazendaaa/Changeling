Welcome to Fazendaaa's {{ pkg.name }}.

## Ideia

Currently, in the company that I work for we have a CLI (Command Line Interface) made in [Python](https://www.python.org/) called `estat` that you can read more about it right [here](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Succubus). Changeling is just a "step-by-step" configurations for Baba Yaga and examples for Succubus projects; supporting languages like:

- [R](recipes/R)
- [Python](recipes/Python)
- [Node](recipes/Node)
- [Julia](recipes/Julia)
- [many more...](recipes/)

As `estat` have grown so much and making it available as FOSS (Free and open-source software) was always the idea but the project still in development and not having a properly defined scope, I decided to break its main features in other projects:

- [Succubus](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Succubus): universal package manager based on cloud-native
- [Jinn](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Jinn): universal project manager built to expand Succubus capabilities
- [Baba Yaga](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/BabaYaga): universal cloud-native manager built to expand Jinn and Succubus capabilities
- [Changeling](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Changeling): universal project translator from cloud-native projects to other infra technologies
- [Shōjō](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/): LaTex package manager
- [Hellhound](github.com/Fazendaaa/Hellhound): VSCode extension to integrate Jinn recipes
- [Crocotta](github.com/Fazendaaa/Crocotta): SOC assisted guider
- [Changeling](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Changeling): Recipes for Succubus and Baba Yaga 

## Author

Only [me](https://github.com/Fazendaaa) because the aforementioned project was implemented by yours only. By knowing each line of that code wrote doing the port would be more easily done this way.
